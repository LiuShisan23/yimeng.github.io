Hi! I am **Yimeng (Emaon) Shan**, an AI & data science researcher currently based between Hong Kong SAR and Guangzhou, China. I focus on large language models, federated learning, and intelligent decision-support systems that bridge research innovation with deployable engineering workflows.

- **Email:** [23058364G@connect.polyu.hk](mailto:23058364G@connect.polyu.hk)
- **Mobile:** +852 6613 3502
- **Current roles:** MSc candidate in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Research Assistant in [Prof. Wei Wang’s Lab](https://dbwangwei.github.io/)
- **Research interests:** Large language models, adaptive federated/split learning, controllable text generation, intelligent recommendation, and cyber-physical optimization.

## Research Highlights

### Tripartite NSFC grant rewriting (2025–present)
As a research assistant in Prof. Wei Wang’s group, I design a hierarchical rewriting framework for NSFC grant applications that enforces entity fidelity while improving scientific narrative quality. The work combines a curated paraphrase database, beam-search reasoning chains via DeepSeek Reasoner, and position-aware structural mapping to ensure consistency with NSFC formats. I also prototype multi-agent collaboration tags and cluster-based prompt engineering to scale expert knowledge capture.

### SplitFT: Adaptive split federated tuning for LLMs (2024–2025)
In collaboration with Dr. Zhaorui Zhang, I built a split learning pipeline for GPT-2-class models that dynamically chooses client cut layers according to data quality and perplexity trends. By combining LoRA-based parameter-efficient tuning with selective rank adjustment, the system attains benchmark-level accuracy while reducing bandwidth and doubling performance on non-IID benchmarks. The first-author manuscript, **SplitFT**, has been submitted to IJCAI.

### Personalized device–cloud recommender (2022–2023)
For my undergraduate thesis under Prof. Weifeng Sun, I engineered a hybrid device/cloud news recommender. The system mixes ItemCF, UserCF, YouTubeDNN recall, and cold-start retrieval, substitutes high-memory user-similarity calculations with an embedding-based approach, and balances accuracy, freshness, and popularity in the final rerank step to sustain user engagement.

## Selected Course Projects

- **Different LoRA schedules for BERT (2024):** Evaluated partial-module LoRA fine-tuning strategies with Dr. Bo Yang, showing 2–7× fewer transmitted parameters and comparable accuracy to full LoRA runs.
- **Characterizing browser-based crypto mining (2023):** With Dr. Xiapu Luo and Prof. Hao Zhou, performed static/dynamic/network analyses (Wireshark monitoring, CPU trend profiling) to expose mining scripts and quantify system impact.
- **Survey of vector databases for the LLM era (2023):** Summarized 50+ publications on VDBMS indexing, retrieval, and LLM-centric applications under Prof. Qing Li.
